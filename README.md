# Medical-Prediction-Website
The website delivers real-time health insights through an intuitive interface, enabling users to receive fast, accurate predictions across multiple conditions.                     
Flask-based web app providing predictive tools for brain tumor detection, heart attack risk, and diabetes assessment. Integrated models include:                  
1)Brain Tumor Detection: SVM model classifies tumor vs. non-tumor images.                                              
2)Heart Attack Prediction: Random Forest model predicts heart attack risk based on user health data.                      
3)Diabetes Prediction: Random Forest classifier assesses diabetes risk.
